Diabetes Prediction web app 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App

A simple and interactive web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-entered health data such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, and age. The app collects input through a clean HTML form and sends it to a backend API (/predict) for machine learning–based prediction results.

🚀 Features

Responsive and easy-to-use interface

Real-time input validation for all fields

Displays prediction outcome and probability

Designed for integration with a FastAPI/Flask ML backend

Lightweight — pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

🧠 How It Works

Enter your health metrics in the form.

The app validates your input.

It sends data to the backend (http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict).

The backend responds with a prediction (e.g., “Diabetic” or “Non-Diabetic”) and a confidence score.
